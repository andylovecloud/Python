Supervised learning is a fundamental approach in predictive analytics, where a model learns from labeled data to make predictions. In this topic, we will focus on the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm, a simple yet powerful classification technique.

#### Cross Validation:
Cross-validation is essential to ensure your model generalizes well to new data. Weâ€™ll use k-fold cross-validation with the kNN algorithm to assess performance.
