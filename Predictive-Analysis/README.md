# TOPIC 1: Supervised Learning (k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm)



Supervised learning is a fundamental approach in predictive analytics, where a model learns from labeled data to make predictions. In this topic, we will focus on the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm, a simple yet powerful classification technique.

### Learning Materials:

## Lecture 01 Slides : Supervised Learning and the kNN Algorithm

Code Examples:

- kNN Algorithm Using the sklearn Library: For hands-on implementation, use this notebook with sklearn to easily apply the kNN algorithm. (Recommended for Assignment 1)
- kNN Algorithm from Scratch (For Practice Only): Understand the inner workings of the kNN algorithm with a Python implementation built from scratch. (Note: This is for practice and not required for Assignment 1).
- Euclidean Distance Notebook

### Cross Validation: Cross-validation is essential to ensure your model generalizes well to new data. Weâ€™ll use k-fold cross-validation with the kNN algorithm to assess performance.

- kNN with k-Fold Cross Validation (Notebook): Explore how to implement k-fold cross-validation using sklearn and kNN to improve model reliability.
