## Recommended Reading List for Data Processing with Python

The following book will be the primary course material for this class:

1. Python for Data Analysis (https://wesmckinney.com/book/)

This book by Wes McKinney provides a comprehensive introduction to data analysis with Python, covering key topics such as data manipulation, analysis with Pandas, and using Numpy and Matplotlib for scientific computing.

To enhance your understanding of the topics covered in this course, the following additional resources are recommended. These materials will support your learning in Python programming, data analysis, and visualization techniques, as well as the Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries. You are encouraged to refer to them throughout the course.

2. General Python Programming
