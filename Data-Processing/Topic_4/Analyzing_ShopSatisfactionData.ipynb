    "### Performing a Chi-Square Test for Education and Gender Dependency\n",
    "\n",
    "A Chi-Square test is performed to assess whether there is a statistically significant relationship between education levels and gender. This helps determine if the observed differences in education distribution between women and men are due to chance or reflect a real dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `chi2_contingency()` function from the `scipy.stats` module is used to perform the test.\n",
    "- The test is conducted on the raw counts from the cross-tabulation (`df5`), as the Chi-Square test requires count data.\n",
    "- The output includes the Chi-Square statistic, the p-value, degrees of freedom, and the expected frequencies.\n"

    "- Since the p-value (0.851) is greater than 0.05, the result suggests that there is no significant dependency between education level and gender in this dataset.\n",
